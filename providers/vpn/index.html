    <p><strong><a href="https://mullvad.net/">Mullvad.net</a> </strong> is a fast and inexpensive VPN with a serious focus on transparency and security. They have been in operation since <strong>2009</strong>. Mullvad is based in <span class="flag-icon flag-icon-se"></span> Sweden and does not have a free trial.</p>
    <h5>
<span
  class="badge badge-success"
  
    >  35 Countries
  
</span>

</h5>
    <p>Mullvad has <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/servers/">servers in 35 countries</a> at the time of writing this page. Picking a VPN provider with a server nearest to you will reduce latency of the network traffic you send. This is because of a shorter route (less hops) to the destination.</p>
    <p>We also think it's better for the security of the VPN provider's private keys if they use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedicated_hosting_service">dedicated servers</a>, instead of cheaper shared solutions (with other customers) such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server">virtual private servers</a>.</p>
    <h5>
<span
  class="badge badge-success"
  
    >  Independently Audited
  
</span>

</h5>
    <p>Mullvad's VPN clients have been audited by Cure53 and Assured AB in a pentest report <a href="https://cure53.de/pentest-report_mullvad_v2.pdf">published at cure53.de</a>. The security researchers concluded:</p>
    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p class="mb-0">...Cure53 and Assured AB are happy with the results of the audit and the software leaves an overall positive impression. With security dedication of the in-house team at the Mullvad VPN compound, the testers have no doubts about the project being on the right track from a security standpoint.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In 2020 a second audit <a href="https://mullvad.net/blog/2020/6/25/results-available-audit-mullvad-app/">was announced</a> and the <a href="https://cure53.de/pentest-report_mullvad_2020_v2.pdf">final audit report</a> was made available on Cure53's website.</p>

</h5>
    <p>Mullvad in addition to accepting credit/debit cards and PayPal, accepts <strong>Bitcoin</strong>, <strong>Bitcoin Cash</strong>, and <strong>cash/local currency</strong> as anonymous forms of payment. They also accept Swish and bank wire transfers.</p>
    <h5>
<span
  class="badge badge-success"
  
    >  WireGuard Support
  
</span>

</h5>
    <p>In addition to standard OpenVPN connections, Mullvad supports WireGuard. WireGuard is an experimental protocol with theoretically better security and higher reliability, although it is not currently recommended for production use.</p>
    <h5>
<span

</h5>
    <p>Mullvad supports the future of networking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6">IPv6</a>. Their network allows users to <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/blog/2014/9/15/ipv6-support/">access services hosted on IPv6</a> as opposed to other providers who block IPv6 connections.</p>

The mobile client on Android is also available in <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/net.mullvad.mullvadvpn">F-Droid</a>, which ensures that it is compiled with <a href="https://www.f-droid.org/en/2019/05/05/trust-privacy-and-free-software.html">reproducible builds</a>.</p></p>

</h5>
    <p>As of January 2020 ProtonVPN has undergone an independent audit by SEC Consult. SEC Consult found some medium and low risk vulnerabilities in ProtonVPN's Windows, Android, and iOS applications, all of which were "properly fixed" by ProtonVPN before the reports were published. None of the issues identified would have provided an attacker remote access to a user's device or traffic.

    <p>The ProtonVPN clients have a built-in killswitch to block internet connections outside of the VPN. They also are able to automatically start on boot. ProtonVPN also offers "Tor" servers allowing you to easily connect to onion sites, but we still strongly recommend using <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">the official Tor Browser</a> for this purpose.</p>

</h5>
    <p>IVPN has <a href="https://www.ivpn.net/server-locations">servers in 32 countries</a> at the time of writing this page. Picking a VPN provider with a server nearest to you will reduce latency of the network traffic you send. This is because of a shorter route (less hops) to the destination.</p>
    <p>We also think it's better for the security of the VPN provider's private keys if they use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedicated_hosting_service">dedicated servers</a>, instead of cheaper shared solutions (with other customers) such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server">virtual private servers</a>.</p>

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h3>Should I use a VPN?</h3>
      <p>The answer to this question is not a particularly helpful one: <strong>It depends.</strong> It depends on what you're expecting a VPN to do for you, who you're trying to hide your traffic from, and what applications you're using.</p>
      <p><strong>In most cases, VPNs do little to protect your privacy or enhance your security</strong>, unless paired with other changes.</p>
      <p>VPNs cannot encrypt data outside of the connection between your device and the VPN server. VPN providers can see and modify your traffic the same way your ISP could. And there is no way to verify a VPN provider's "no logging" policies in any way besides gaining access to the VPN server, which usually isn't possible.</p>
	  <p>If you're trying to do something illegal; first of all, don't do it at all, whether a VPN is involved or not, second of all, a VPN won't help you much.</p>
      <h3>What if I need encryption?</h3>
      <p>In most cases, most of your traffic is already encrypted! Over 98% of the top 3000 websites offer <strong>HTTPS</strong>, meaning your non-DNS traffic is safe regardless of using a VPN. It is incredibly rare for applications that handle personal data to not support HTTPS in 2021, especially with services like Let's Encrypt offering free HTTPS certificates to any website operator. You shouldn't trust any website that does not support HTTPS.</p>
      <p>Even if a site you visit doesn't support HTTPS, a VPN will not protect you, because a VPN cannot magically encrypt the traffic between the VPN's servers and the website's servers. Installing an extension like <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</a> and making sure every site you visit uses HTTPS is far more helpful than using a VPN if you're worried about lack of encryption.</p>
      <h4>Should I use encrypted DNS with a VPN?</h4>
      <p>The answer to this question is also not very helpful: <strong>it depends</strong>. Your VPN provider may have their own DNS servers, but if they don't, the traffic between your VPN provider and the DNS server isn't encrypted. You need to trust the <a href="../dns/index.html#icanndns">encrypted DNS provider</a> in addition to the VPN provider and unless your client and target server support <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/09/esni-privacy-protecting-upgrade-https">encrypted SNI</a>, the VPN provider can still see which domains you are visiting.</p>
      <p>However <strong>you shouldn't use encrypted DNS with Tor</strong>. This would direct all of your DNS requests through a single circuit, and would allow the encrypted DNS provider to deanonymize you. Not the best idea.</p>
      <h3>What if I need anonymity?</h3>
      <p>VPNs cannot provide strong anonymity. Your VPN provider will still see your real IP address, and often has a money trail that can be linked directly back to you. You cannot rely on just "no logging" policies to protect your data, but this is not to say that VPNs are not useful.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h3>Shouldn't I hide my IP address?</h3>
      <p>The idea that your IP address is sensitive information, or that your location is given away with all your internet traffic is <strong>fearmongering</strong> on the part of VPN providers and their marketing. Your IP address is an insignificant amount of personal data tracking companies use to identify you, because many users' IP addresses change very frequently (Dynamic IP addresses, switching networks, switching devices, etc.). Your IP address also does not give away more than the very generalized location of your Internet Service Provider. It does not give away your home address, for example, despite common perception.</p>
      <h3>Should I use Tor <em>and</em> a VPN?</h3>
      <p>By using a VPN with Tor, you're creating essentially a permanent entry node, often with a money trail attached. This provides 0 additional benefit to you, while increasing the attack surface of your connection dramatically. If you wish to hide your Tor usage from your ISP or your government, Tor has a built-in solution for that: Tor bridges. <a href="https://write.privacytools.io/my-thoughts-on-security/slicing-onions-part-2-onion-recipes-vpn-not-required">Read more about Tor bridges and why using a VPN is not necessary</a>.</p>
      <h3>Are VPNs ever useful?</h3>
      <p>A VPN may still be useful to you in a variety of scenarios, such as:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Hiding your traffic from <strong>only</strong> your Internet Service Provider.</li>
        <li>Hiding your downloads (such as torrents) from your ISP and anti-piracy organizations.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>For use cases like these, or if you have another compelling reason, the VPN providers we listed above are who we think are the most trustworthy. However, using a VPN provider still means you're <em>trusting</em> the provider. In pretty much any other scenario you should be using a secure<strong>-by-design</strong> tool such as Tor.</p>
